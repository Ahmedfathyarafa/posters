Hi, this is what changed in this _es version:

on the graphics:

- Created a grid providing a 3cm safety area and keeping all the graphic elements within an area of 10x10cm. It´s easier for the eye to scan and find its way through the piece.
- Removed vertical lines as the left alignment of the elements already creates that division for the eye.
- Removed background from the main title having better contrast and establishing a clearer point of entrance to the piece. 
- Changed the text to medium and 32px to fit the content easily.
- Created an .ai document for those who don´t have .sketch

on the spanish translation:

*I´m Argentinian but tried to use a neutral spanish.

- Do-Don´t was translated as ¨yes¨ and ¨no¨ to favor the reading of the whole phrase.
- The equivalent to the metaphor ¨It´s raining cats and dogs¨ in spanish would be ¨esta lloviendo a cántaros¨ . I believe it isn´t that frequently used although most people in Spain and latin america would get it.
